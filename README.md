# Anomaly detection methods - proposed by Pavlo Mozharovskyi

This workshop was led by **Pavlo Mozharovskyi**, associate professor at **Télécom ParisEkimetrics**.  
It took place for the first time in person and remotely on September 10, 2021 at datacrat Paris,

Anomaly detection (Chandola et al., 2009) is a branch of machine learning which aims at identifying observations that exhibit abnormal behavior. Be it measurement errors, disease development, severe weather, production quality default(s) (items) or failed equipment, financial frauds or crisis events, their on-time identification, isolation and explanation constitute an important task in almost any branch of industry and science.

During the workshops, the following topics were discussed:
 - the concept of data depth in both functional and multivariate settings,
 - review most common notion of the depth function (halfspace (Tukey, 1975), projection (Zuo & Sefling,2000), zonoid (Mosler, 2002), spatial depth (Koltchinskii, 1997); integrated (Claeskens et al., 2014) and curve (Lafaye De Micheaux et al., 2020) functional depths, functional isolation forest Staerman et al. (2019)
 - focus on a number of real-world applications ranging from simulated situations to hurricane tracks and brain imaging.
